    <p>Currently, I have completed my B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing from <b>Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior,</b> with a CGPA of 7.7.</p>
    <p>From the beginning of my engineering, I’ve always been interested in <b>technology, web development, and problem-solving.</b> I’ve done several minor projects, like:</p>

    <p>In terms of technical skills, I’m comfortable with languages like C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and frameworks like <b>React.js, Node.js,</b> and also familiar with databases like <b>MongoDB and MySQL.</b></p>
